This tool was built as my final project for 'UVA ARCH5424 Direct Cinema Media Fabrics' using P5JS and is currently hosted on glitch.com. A few years ago I made a music visualizer in Cycling 74's Max/MSP but I wanted to build one from scratch this time in javascript. I have also been wanting to learn more about WebGL for a long time and this was my first foray into it. Try it out at the provided link and let me know what you think!
